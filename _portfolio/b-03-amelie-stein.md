<p class="item-body">A/Prof Stein's lab studies the consequences of sequence variants on proteins, focusing on their cellular stability and function. The group performs high-throughput assays on protein variants and build on this data to develop and improve methods for prediction of variant consequences. They then apply these methods to determine whether genomic variants are likely to be pathogenic. Further they aim to integrate effects of multiple mutations for applications in protein engineering.
