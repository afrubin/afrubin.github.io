<p class="item-body">A/Prof Chris Hahn has been Section Head of the Molecular Pathology Research Laboratory at the Centre for Cancer Biology in Adelaide, Australia since 2008. He is a co-leader of the Australian Familial Haematological Conditions Study where his work focusses on gene discovery in over 260 families predisposed to blood cancers and/or bone marrow failure. His research has led to discovery of <i>GATA2</i>, <i>PAX5</i> and, more recently, <i>ERG</i> as novel germline predisposition genes, while also reporting new variants and expanded phenotypes for a range of other genes such as <i>RUNX1</i>, <i>CEBPA</i>, <i>SAMD9</i>, <i>MECOM</i> and <i>RPS26</i>. As a molecular biologist, he has developed numerous bespoke assays for testing the function of variants in these genes, including transactivation assays for GATA2 which are considered “gold standard” by the ClinGen Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel for functional assessment of GATA2 variants. He is passionate about translating research findings into clinical diagnostics and the clinic to benefit patients and their families.</p>
