Prof Maitreya Dunham develops and applies genomic tools to study genome evolution and genetic variation in yeast and humans. Her lab utilizes the budding yeasts as a testbed for technology development and as an experimentally tractable system for evolutionary genetics and genomics.  By leveraging these systems in creative ways, they hope to learn in molecular detail how cells evolve and the mechanisms by which they do so, addressing important open questions on mutation spectrum, genome structure, mechanisms and consequences of copy number change, genetic interactions, evolution of gene expression, and other fundamental topics.
