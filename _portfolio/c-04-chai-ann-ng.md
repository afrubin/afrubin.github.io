<p class="item-body">Dr. Chai-Ann Ng completed his PhD at La Trobe University in 2009. His postdoctoral work was undertaken at the Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, earning him the Young Biophysicist of the Year Award in 2013. He is now a Senior Staff Scientist at the Institute and a conjoint Senior Lecturer at UNSW.

Dr Ng is an expert member on two ClinGen Variant Curation panels (Cardiac Potassium and Sodium/Calcium channels), working on global guidelines for variant interpretation. His research addresses the challenge of variants of uncertain significance in inherited arrhythmia syndromes using Automated Patch Clamp electrophysiology.

Dr. Ng has translated research into clinical practice by collaborating with key diagnostic labs nationally and internationally to improve variant classification and diagnoses. His leadership in translating research to improve health outcomes was recognised by his selection as a Finalist for the 2024 Australian Cardiovascular Alliance Game Changer Award.</p>
