<p class="item-body">Nilah Ioannidis recently joined UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and the Center for Computational Biology at UC Berkeley. She is also a Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator. Her research group develops machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to interpret individual genomes and model variation in gene expression and other molecular and cellular phenotypes. Ioannidis received her Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard University, where she modeled intracellular particle dynamics. She completed postdoctoral work at Stanford University, developing variant pathogenicity predictors for rare disease and clinical genomics applications.</p>
