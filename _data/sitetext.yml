      On behalf of the [Atlas of Variant Effects (AVE) Alliance](https://www.varianteffect.org/)
      and the conference organizing committee, we are delighted to welcome you to 
      Melbourne, Australia for the 2026 Mutational Scanning Symposium (MSS26)
      on 25th-27th March, 2026.

      The MSS is a cornerstone event for the functional genomics community.
      Since its inception in 2017, we have brought together delegates from across the globe,
      fostering field-defining discussions and collaborations.

      <img src="assets/img/about/AVE_logo.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Atlas of Variant Effects Alliance Logo">

      MSS26 will convene experts and trainees in the fields of 
      functional genomics, protein science, precision medicine, variant interpretation, and computational genomics
      from around the world to meet, present their work, share expertise and provide insights into the future of this field.

      The event will take place at the 
      [Aikenhead Centre for Medical Discovery (ACMD)](https://acmd.org.au/) in Melbourne, Australia.
      ACMD is a new centre for biomedical engineering and translational research that
      brings together multiple leading national universities and research institutes with a major
      tertiary hospital. 
      Its unique combination of research and industry tenants means that it is uniquely positioned to tackle
      some of the world’s most challenging health problems,
      and the building has been purpose-built to foster collaborative research,
      with multiple floors set aside for industry partners and start-ups.
      
      ACMD is co-located at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, at the corner of Nicholson St and
      Victoria Parade, with fantastic access for local attendees and visiting guests both.

      The event will also include selected trainee presentations and posters, a clinically-focused
      workshop, industry contributions and a session on the AVE Alliance.
      MSS26 will be an in-person event, with live-streamed plenary sessions.
