**TRAVELING TO MELBOURNE**

Melbourne may be quite far away, but is easy to get to from most places in the world
with nonstop flights from California as well as major Asian and Middle Eastern hubs.

Note that most visitors will need to obtain a visa to enter Australia.
This is usually straightforward and can be done electronically at any time,
but please allow for processing delays and make sure you have your visa sorted out before your flight.

Also note that Australia has very strict biosecurity laws limiting what you are able to bring into the country.

For more information on traveling to Australia, including visa elegibility,
[visit this site](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/entering-australia)
or consult the website for your nationality's Australian consulate.

If you need to request an invitation letter for visa purposes, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.
